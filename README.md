# This is my 260 Startup file
Testing how this works!

## Startup Specification
**Elevator Pitch**
I want to create an application that asks quiz questions to determine which Knight Radiant a user would be. Knight Radiants are a group of warriors created by author Brandon Sanderson. They personify certain ideals such as honor or creativity and are granted certain abilities depending. Think of it like a peronality quiz, or hogwarts house sorting but for Brandon Sanderson fans.

**Key Features**
1. Users will create a login to save their answers and results.
2. A database will save each users score and show their result.
3. In real time, users can see current users Radiant order when discovered (when they finish the quiz)

**Technology**
1. HTML will be used to create the web page. This is the backbone of my website.
2. CSS will make a thematic visual. Not sure what this means yet, but I hope to make the buttons look nice, perhaps add visual featuers on each question such as a picture or graphic.
3. Javascript will be added so users can interact and click on options. Users should be able to access saved scores, an about page, as well as click options for the questions.
4. Web service will be used to collect and call upon saved scores/results. Be able to pull up old scores.
5. Authentication for users to login and save their results. It will be helpful to have a username to attach to results.
6. Database persistence to save all user results.
7. WebSocket for users to see in real time other users Radiant Order.
8. Web Framework for technical support.

**Rough Imaging**

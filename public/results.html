                <p class="card-text">
                    The Willshapers believe strongly that all people should be free to make their own choices.
                    Their oaths are themed toward freedom and letting people be free to express themselves and make their
                    own way in life.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The Willshapers have a reputation for attracting builders, craftspeople, and creators to the Radiants.
                    However, while this aspect of them is accurate, the actual membership of the Order is far more varied.
                    Their powers lend themselves to creation, true, but their oaths are focused on freedom and personal
                    fulfillment.
                    Many among the Willshapers are warriors focused on freeing those who are captive, and others are
                    focused on radical self-expression.
                    The Willshapers contain many gregarious and even flamboyant characters who make their own way, taking
                    the path they choose.
                    They are united through a love of building, but some consider the building of society to be more
                    important than the building of structures.
                    Among the Willshapers, you’ll find both those who dress very conservatively and those who wear very
                    daring and original styles.
                    The common ground is that both agree that freedom to express who you are is the important part.
                    Among the Radiants, they are generally focused on building, training, and making infrastructure.
                    In war, they might be sent to a town to fortify it against an oncoming invasion.
                    Before or in the wake of Desolations, they would teach the people things like sanitation, bronzeworking,
                    or other essentials.
                    Anywhere you find someone resisting tyranny or oppression, you’ll often find a Willshaper cheering them
                    on.

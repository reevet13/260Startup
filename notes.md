# Notes
## Git Practice
Not gonna lie, this stuff is hard to grasp for me.\n
1. edit your file\n
2. save those changes\n
3. choose which changes you're willing to fully commit to\n
4. commit, meaning it saves it\n
5. push to github, or make it official on the website\n

**AWS Setup**  
This stuff was also hard. Basically it sounds like I have my own personal server space that I'm kind of paying for (mostly free?) and this is where my website physically lives.

**HTML**  
Finally something I understand\n  
HTML is basically just a ton of nesting and proper labelling.\n  
To Do: Memorize the cheat sheet ASAP

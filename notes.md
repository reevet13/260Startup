# Notes
## Git Practice
Not gonna lie, this stuff is hard to grasp for me.
1. edit your file
2. save those changes
3. choose which changes you're willing to fully commit to
4. commit, meaning it saves it
5. push to github, or make it official on the website

**AWS Setup**  
This stuff was also hard. Basically it sounds like I have my own personal server space that I'm kind of paying for (mostly free?) and this is where my website physically lives.

**HTML**  
Finally something I understand   
HTML is basically just a ton of nesting and proper labelling.  
To Do: Memorize the cheat sheet ASAP

Depositing simon-html to my domain was simple enough.  
I think I should move my production environment off of my desktop so I can streamline my depositing and cloning.  
Probably going to copy the header and footer
